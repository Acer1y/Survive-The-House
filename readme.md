Survive The House!

****** DEAD BRANCH ******

This branch has been abandonded. I hit the end of what I could accompolish with how the game is setup. 

    Need to create new game folders and module. As well as add map of objects of rooms and house items among other changes. 

***** This is a game created just to see what I could accomplish, and so far it's turned into a bigger project than I had ever expected. As of now, I have the web page functional along with an in game heartbeat for tracking time. 

The premise is that an apocalyptic event happens and a monster of sorts has been made of humanity. You somehow survived, and took shelter inside the first house you could find. You need to survive for as long as you can! 

Do not create too much noise, as if you do the THINGS will be attracted and won't stop attacking until it can get to you.
